        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Chicken:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups canola oil for frying</li>
            <li>3 ¾ pounds chicken drumsticks</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup potato starch, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
            <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons black sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Set a rack on a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toss chicken, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread 1/2 cup potato starch in a shallow dish; dredge chicken to coat completely and evenly. Add remaining 1/2 cup potato starch as needed. Shake off excess and transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add chicken to the skillet carefully, working in batches; fry until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chicken over and fry until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 175 degrees F (80 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to the rack on the prepared baking sheet. Reheat oil between batches to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Return chicken to the skillet in batches and fry again, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Stir gochujang, oyster sauce, mirin, ketchup, fish sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Add cooked chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle with white and black sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
